<!-- Server-level override of Contributor configuration is done in {RSUITE_HOME}/conf/contributor.xml, which follows the same format as this file -->
<!-- 
	* This is the `defaults` version of the file, embedded in the plugin.  It is used only if the server-level file is not present.
	* All @labels in this version of the file are message references, indicated by the leading '/'.  @labels without the leading '/' are treated as raw user-facing text
	* Most icons in this file are references to a named RSuite font icon (see: RSuite.Icon.getIconManifest() on the console of a running instance); 
	* One icon is a reference to an icon in the O2 integration plugin, demonstrating how to use image icons
